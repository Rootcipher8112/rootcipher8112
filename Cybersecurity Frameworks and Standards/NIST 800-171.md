# NIST 800-171: Specific Guidelines

**NIST 800-171** is a subset of NIST 800-53 that focuses on protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in non-federal information systems and organizations. It provides a set of security requirements to safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access.

## Core Components of NIST 800-171

### 1. **14 Control Families**
- **Guideline**: NIST 800-171 organizes its security requirements into 14 control families:
  - **Access Control (AC)**: Limit access to CUI based on user roles and needs.
  - **Awareness and Training (AT)**: Educate staff on security policies and procedures.
  - **Audit and Accountability (AU)**: Implement logging and monitoring of system activity.
  - **Configuration Management (CM)**: Maintain secure configurations for IT resources.
  - **Identification and Authentication (IA)**: Verify user identities and manage credentials.
  - **Incident Response (IR)**: Prepare for and respond to security incidents.
  - **Maintenance (MA)**: Control maintenance processes to ensure security.
  - **Media Protection (MP)**: Safeguard data stored on various media types.
  - **Personnel Security (PS)**: Ensure that personnel accessing CUI are trustworthy.
  - **Physical Protection (PE)**: Secure physical access to IT and data resources.
  - **Risk Assessment (RA)**: Identify and evaluate potential risks.
  - **Security Assessment (CA)**: Regularly assess security controls for effectiveness.
  - **System and Communications Protection (SC)**: Secure communications and data transmission.
  - **System and Information Integrity (SI)**: Protect systems from malware and ensure data accuracy.

### 2. **Basic and Derived Security Requirements**
- **Guideline**: Each control family consists of **basic** and **derived** security requirements that organizations must meet.
- **Details**:
  - **Basic Requirements**: Fundamental security practices (e.g., restricting user access).
  - **Derived Requirements**: More detailed practices to support the basic requirements (e.g., implementing multi-factor authentication).

## Key Guidelines and Subcomponents of NIST 800-171

### 1. **Access Control (AC)**
- **Guideline**: Ensure only authorized personnel have access to CUI.
- **Details**: Implement role-based access controls and manage session timeouts.

### 2. **Audit and Accountability (AU)**
- **Guideline**: Maintain audit logs that track user activity and system events.
- **Details**: Ensure logs are protected from unauthorized changes and reviewed periodically.

### 3. **Configuration Management (CM)**
- **Guideline**: Implement and maintain secure configurations for all devices and systems.
- **Details**: Use baseline configurations and control changes through an approval process.

### 4. **Incident Response (IR)**
- **Guideline**: Establish an incident response plan that defines roles, responsibilities, and response procedures.
- **Details**: Test and update the plan regularly to reflect new threats and vulnerabilities.

### 5. **System and Information Integrity (SI)**
- **Guideline**: Protect systems from known vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.
- **Details**: Deploy anti-malware tools, apply security patches promptly, and monitor for suspicious activities.

## Implementation Steps for NIST 800-171

### 1. **Identify and Categorize CUI**
- **Step**: Determine the types of CUI handled and where they are stored, processed, or transmitted.
- **Action**: Document the flow of CUI within the organization to define the protection scope.

### 2. **Perform a Gap Analysis**
- **Step**: Compare current security practices against NIST 800-171 requirements.
- **Action**: Identify deficiencies and create a plan to address them.

### 3. **Develop and Implement Policies**
- **Step**: Create security policies that align with NIST 800-171 requirements.
- **Action**: Ensure policies cover access control, incident response, and configuration management.

### 4. **Train Employees**
- **Step**: Conduct training programs to educate employees on handling CUI securely.
- **Action**: Include awareness sessions on phishing attacks, proper data handling, and incident reporting.

### 5. **Implement Technical Controls**
- **Step**: Deploy tools and technologies to enforce security requirements, such as firewalls, encryption, and MFA.
- **Action**: Ensure technical solutions are configured properly and updated regularly.

### 6. **Monitor and Audit Systems**
- **Step**: Continuously monitor system activities and audit compliance with security policies.
- **Action**: Address non-compliance promptly and revise processes as necessary.

## Benefits of Implementing NIST 800-171

- **CUI Protection**: Provides a structured approach to safeguard sensitive information.
- **Enhanced Security Posture**: Strengthens overall cybersecurity practices by integrating proven controls.
- **Compliance Assurance**: Helps organizations meet federal contract requirements, especially for defense contractors.
- **Trust and Credibility**: Demonstrates a commitment to protecting sensitive data, boosting credibility with government agencies and clients.

## Practical Applications of NIST 800-171

### 1. **Defense Contractors**
- **Application**: Required for any company that processes, stores, or transmits CUI to comply with the **DFARS** (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement).
- **Details**: Essential for maintaining eligibility for federal contracts.

### 2. **Manufacturers and Supply Chain Partners**
- **Application**: Used by manufacturing firms and supply chain partners that work with the Department of Defense (DoD) or handle CUI.
- **Details**: Ensures that CUI remains protected across the supply chain.

### 3. **Educational and Research Institutions**
- **Application**: Universities and research institutions handling CUI in government-funded projects align with NIST 800-171 to secure data.
- **Details**: Protects research data and intellectual property from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
