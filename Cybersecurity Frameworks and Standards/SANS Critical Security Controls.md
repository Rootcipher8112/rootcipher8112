# SANS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls): Specific Guidelines

**SANS Critical Security Controls**, now managed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), are a set of best practices designed to help organizations bolster their cybersecurity defenses. These controls are mapped into prioritized guidelines to protect against the most common and significant cyber threats.

## Core Components of the SANS Critical Security Controls

### 1. **Implementation Groups (IGs)**
- **Guideline**: The CIS Controls are divided into three Implementation Groups (IGs) based on the size, resources, and risk exposure of the organization:
  - **IG1 (Basic Cyber Hygiene)**: Essential for small businesses and organizations with limited resources.
  - **IG2 (Intermediate)**: Suitable for organizations handling sensitive data or exposed to moderate risk.
  - **IG3 (Advanced)**: Designed for enterprises with high-value assets and a greater risk profile.
- **Details**: These groups help organizations prioritize and scale their security measures.

### 2. **18 Key Security Controls**
- **Guideline**: The controls are organized into 18 main areas that address the fundamental aspects of cybersecurity:
  1. **Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets**: Maintain an up-to-date asset inventory.
  2. **Inventory and Control of Software Assets**: Identify and manage software within the network.
  3. **Data Protection**: Implement measures to secure data at rest and in transit.
  4. **Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software**: Enforce security configurations.
  5. **Account Management**: Control user access to data and assets.
  6. **Access Control Management**: Implement least privilege and access control measures.
  7. **Continuous Vulnerability Management**: Regularly assess and remediate vulnerabilities.
  8. **Audit Log Management**: Collect and review logs for suspicious activities.
  9. **Email and Web Browser Protections**: Protect against phishing and browser exploits.
  10. **Malware Defenses**: Deploy tools to detect and remove malware.
  11. **Data Recovery Capabilities**: Ensure backup and recovery processes.
  12. **Network Infrastructure Management**: Secure and manage network infrastructure.
  13. **Security Awareness and Skills Training**: Train employees on cybersecurity best practices.
  14. **Service Provider Management**: Evaluate third-party providers' security measures.
  15. **Application Software Security**: Secure development and deployment practices.
  16. **Incident Response Management**: Prepare for and manage security incidents.
  17. **Penetration Testing**: Regularly test security through simulated attacks.
  18. **Security Incident Management**: Develop and execute comprehensive monitoring and response plans.

## Key Guidelines and Specific Components of the SANS Critical Security Controls

### 1. **Asset Management**
- **Guideline**: Maintain a comprehensive inventory of assets, including hardware and software.
- **Details**: Automated asset discovery tools can be used to detect unauthorized devices and software on the network.

### 2. **Data Protection Strategies**
- **Guideline**: Implement data encryption, data loss prevention (DLP), and strict access controls.
- **Details**: Ensure that sensitive data is categorized and protected based on its classification.

### 3. **Vulnerability Management and Patch Application**
- **Guideline**: Perform regular scans and apply patches promptly.
- **Details**: Establish a vulnerability management process that identifies, evaluates, and remediates security weaknesses.

### 4. **Security Awareness Training**
- **Guideline**: Conduct periodic training programs to keep employees aware of phishing, social engineering, and basic security practices.
- **Details**: Tailor training to address current threats and incorporate simulated phishing tests.

### 5. **Incident Response and Recovery**
- **Guideline**: Develop an incident response plan outlining how to detect, respond to, and recover from incidents.
- **Details**: Regularly test and update the plan to ensure readiness.

## Implementation Steps for the SANS Critical Security Controls

### 1. **Assess Current Security Posture**
- **Step**: Conduct an initial assessment to identify existing gaps in security controls.
- **Action**: Map current practices to the CIS Controls framework and prioritize improvements.

### 2. **Determine Implementation Group**
- **Step**: Classify the organization into IG1, IG2, or IG3 based on risk and resource levels.
- **Action**: Start with IG1 controls and expand to IG2 and IG3 as necessary.

### 3. **Develop and Enforce Security Policies**
- **Step**: Create policies that align with the selected controls.
- **Action**: Ensure policies cover key areas such as account management, vulnerability management, and data protection.

### 4. **Deploy Technical Controls**
- **Step**: Implement technical solutions for monitoring, detection, and prevention of threats.
- **Action**: Utilize SIEM systems, endpoint protection tools, and automated patch management.

### 5. **Train and Educate Staff**
- **Step**: Provide cybersecurity training tailored to different roles within the organization.
- **Action**: Use continuous learning approaches and simulated phishing exercises to improve staff readiness.

### 6. **Review and Update Controls**
- **Step**: Periodically assess the effectiveness of the controls and update them based on evolving threats.
- **Action**: Use metrics to track progress and identify areas for further improvement.

## Practical Applications of the SANS Critical Security Controls

### 1. **Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)**
- **Application**: Implement IG1 controls for basic cyber hygiene and protection against common attacks.
- **Details**: Start with fundamental controls like asset inventory and secure configurations.

### 2. **Large Enterprises**
- **Application**: Implement IG2 or IG3 controls to protect complex environments and sensitive data.
- **Details**: Utilize advanced practices such as continuous monitoring, penetration testing, and adaptive response strategies.

### 3. **Security Operations Centers (SOCs)**
- **Application**: Use the controls to guide monitoring, threat detection, and incident response processes.
- **Details**: Map existing tools and processes to CIS Controls to identify coverage gaps and enhance SOC efficiency.
