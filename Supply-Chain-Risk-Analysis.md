# Supply Chain Risk Analysis Scenario

## Overview
For this project, you will write a research-based report on Cyber and IT supply chain risks which the client company, Sifers-Grayson, must be aware of. This report will be presented to the company’s executive leadership to help them understand the overall problem of Cyber and IT supply chain risk. This problem has been raised to the attention of the company’s executive leadership by two influential customers – the US Department of Defense and US Department of Homeland Security. These two customers have raised concerns about the company’s preparedness to address and mitigate cybersecurity risks which could result from supply chain attacks. In their letter to Sifers-Grayson, these customers asked the company, "what are you doing to prevent supply chain attacks?"

## Background
Nofsinger consultants met with the government officials and learned that they were concerned about managing the risks from attacks such as the 2020 SolarWinds attack and longstanding trojans/backdoor attacks in network hardware (e.g., Huawei routers) and computer system components. The SolarWinds attack compromised the software update mechanisms for a widely used set of network management tools (Korolov, 2021). Supply chain attacks which compromise hardware components purchased from non-US sources are also of concern.

Nofsinger consultants also analyzed the internal business processes involved in the engineering supply chain for client Sifers-Grayson. They have learned that, when a Sifers-Grayson engineer needs parts to build a robot or drone, the engineer will place an internal order from the company’s parts stockroom. If the stockroom does not have the part immediately available, an employee will place an order with an approved vendor. These vendors are equipment resellers who purchase components from a number of manufacturers and suppliers. The company also makes purchases of components for some systems via e-Commerce websites and has encountered supply chain issues as a result of using these systems to purchase common components such as CPU chips, memory chips, programmable control chips, power supplies, graphics cards, network interface cards, and mass storage devices. Some may be brand-name components while other, less expensive products, are made by companies who are less well known. They also learned that Sifers-Grayson does not have a controlled process for testing software updates prior to the updates being installed on computer systems in the company’s R&D labs.

Finally, the consultants learned through interviews that, at times, there are supply chain shortages which may result in a reseller substituting generic products for brand-name products. The consultants informed Sifers-Grayson that such substitutions can increase risks associated with purchasing products from third parties whose reputations are unknown or less well established. The company responded that it has a quality assurance process which checks purchased parts for physical damage or lack of functionality. The consultants believe that this process can be improved to reduce the likelihood of an undetected supply chain attack (e.g., malware loaded onto a USB or SSID mass storage device, programmable control chip, etc.).

# Risk Analysis

## Introduction
In today’s global marketplace, supply chain security is crucial, especially for industries relying on Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Companies like Sifers-Grayson, specializing in manufacturing robots and drones, must ensure the integrity of both hardware and software supply chains to maintain operational stability and safeguard sensitive data. Supply chain risks can manifest in various forms, including hardware vulnerabilities like backdoor exploits in network equipment and compromised software updates, as seen in high-profile attacks such as SolarWinds (National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST], n.d.). The challenge is further complicated by the lack of visibility into third-party processes, which increases risks.

For Sifers-Grayson, managing supply chain risk is essential to protect proprietary technology and maintain trust with critical customers like the U.S. Department of Defense. As these customers raise concerns about potential supply chain attacks, the company must adopt a multi-tiered approach to mitigate risks at every stage. This requires leveraging best practices outlined by bodies like NIST, which provides guidelines for addressing adversarial and non-adversarial threats (NIST, n.d.).

## Cyber and IT Supply Chain Risks

### Overview
Sifers-Grayson, like many organizations in the manufacturing industry, faces significant cyber and IT supply chain risks that could potentially compromise its operations, products, and services. These risks stem from the complexity and interdependence of global supply chains, which introduce various vulnerabilities at different stages of procurement, manufacturing, and distribution. The interconnected nature of suppliers and their sub-suppliers increases the attack surface, making the company susceptible to breaches even if their internal defenses are strong (Tung, 2021). Moreover, with the growing adoption of emerging technologies such as IoT and machine learning, the risks associated with supply chain attacks have increased, as these devices often lack built-in security features (Cyber Security Hub, 2023). In this environment, understanding and managing supply chain risks is essential for mitigating potential disruptions and safeguarding the integrity of Sifers-Grayson’s critical systems.

Cyber and IT supply chain attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in both hardware and software components, with attackers targeting either the physical infrastructure or the code and systems used in production and operations. These risks are particularly relevant for companies like Sifers-Grayson, which relies on third-party vendors for hardware components, such as control chips and network devices, and software updates necessary for programming and testing their robotics and drone systems. A failure to properly manage these risks could lead to disruptions in manufacturing or the compromise of proprietary technology, which would damage the company’s reputation and its relationships with critical customers such as the U.S. Department of Defense (Boyens et al., 2021).

#### A. Hardware Supply Chain Risks
The hardware supply chain at Sifers-Grayson faces significant risks due to the complexities and interdependencies of modern global supply chains. One key risk involves vulnerabilities in network devices sourced from third-party suppliers. For instance, Vodafone discovered security flaws in Huawei routers, which had the potential to provide unauthorized access to sensitive data, although both companies denied these flaws were backdoors. This example highlights how hardware vulnerabilities in network components can be exploited, particularly when supplied by companies with questionable security practices (Neate, 2019). For Sifers-Grayson, the reliance on third-party hardware, such as network devices and control chips, increases the potential for such vulnerabilities to compromise their critical systems.

Another pressing concern is the security risks posed by private 5G networks, which are increasingly being adopted in manufacturing environments. These networks offer improved connectivity, but they also introduce new attack vectors. Trend Micro's research found that attackers could exploit weaknesses in the core network of private 5G systems to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks, disrupting manufacturing processes and compromising user data (Private 5G Security Risks in Manufacturing Part 4, 2021). Such vulnerabilities could severely disrupt Sifers-Grayson’s production processes, especially if attackers gain access to critical control systems via compromised 5G networks.

In addition to these risks, hardware trojans present another significant threat. A hardware trojan is a malicious modification to a hardware component, which can be inserted at various stages of production. These trojans can be difficult to detect and may cause a range of issues, from shutting down devices to weakening cryptographic security. As supply chains become more disaggregated and involve multiple third-party vendors, the risk of hardware trojan insertion increases (Hardware Trojan Attacks and Countermeasures, 2014). For Sifers-Grayson, such trojans could compromise the functionality and security of the robotics and drones they manufacture, posing significant risks to both operations and customer trust.

#### B. Software Supply Chain Risks
Software supply chain attacks have emerged as a critical threat to organizations like Sifers-Grayson, especially when integrating third-party software into their systems. One of the most prominent examples of a software supply chain attack was the SolarWinds breach, where attackers compromised SolarWinds Orion software updates to deliver a backdoor called SUNBURST. This attack affected thousands of organizations globally, including major government agencies such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon. The attackers were able to access sensitive systems by embedding malicious code in legitimate software updates, emphasizing how even trusted vendors can introduce significant vulnerabilities into a supply chain (Mandiant, 2020). For Sifers-Grayson, relying on third-party software without robust verification can expose their systems to similar risks, especially if adequate safeguards are not in place to ensure software integrity.

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) poses several risks when it comes to supply chain security, particularly when malicious actors can insert vulnerabilities during any phase of the process. For example, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in contractor systems or subcomponents during the engineering and manufacturing development phases, embedding malware in firmware or software updates that later get distributed across multiple systems. These attacks typically go undetected until the compromised software is deployed in the target environment (Heinbockel et al., 2017). Such risks highlight the importance of Sifers-Grayson implementing comprehensive security measures throughout the SDLC to ensure that no malicious code or backdoors are introduced into critical systems.

Another area of concern in software supply chains is the use of open-source components. Open-source software is widely adopted across industries, but it presents its own set of challenges. According to Sonatype's 2020 report, 90% of all applications contain open-source code, with 11% having known vulnerabilities. Attackers are increasingly targeting open-source projects by introducing vulnerabilities into the software development process, as demonstrated by the 2017 Equifax breach. In that case, attackers exploited an unpatched open-source vulnerability, resulting in a breach that cost the company nearly $2 billion in damages (Korolov, 2024). For Sifers-Grayson, carefully vetting open-source components and applying security checks is essential to avoid becoming the next victim of a similar attack.

## Best Practices for Mitigating Cyber and IT Supply Chain Risks

Supply chain cybersecurity involves addressing risks from vendors, partners, and third parties, each of whom may introduce vulnerabilities into an organization's ecosystem. Best practices for mitigating these risks focus on ensuring comprehensive security measures are applied throughout the supply chain, from physical hardware to software, network connections, and data.

1. **Vendor Risk Management**
    Managing third-party vendors is a critical aspect of supply chain risk management. According to Exelon Corporation’s approach, their vendor management process begins with a thorough vendor security screening that assesses how well vendors vet their personnel, services, and products (Wilcox & Minton, 2015). This includes background checks on vendor employees, assessments of vendor facilities, and verification of the security of the products provided.
    
2. **Defining Security Standards and Controls**
    Establishing clear security controls and standards for third parties is crucial. Security experts such as Chadd Carr recommend that companies define reasonable security levels and associated controls, requiring vendors and subcontractors to meet these standards as a condition of doing business (Demers, n.d.). These controls include monitoring and logging vendor access to sensitive systems, conducting regular risk assessments, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS or HIPAA, depending on the industry. These measures help prevent unauthorized access and reduce the likelihood of data breaches or system compromises from supply chain partners.
    
3. **Continuous Monitoring and Incident Response**
    Continuous monitoring of vendors' activities is another best practice to ensure the security of the supply chain. Steve Durbin emphasizes that businesses should map the flow of information shared with suppliers and monitor key access points to detect any signs of compromise (Demers, n.d.). Exelon’s Security Operation Center (CyberSOC) continuously monitors the state of its networks and vendor interactions, using advanced detection capabilities to identify anomalies or potential attacks in real-time (Wilcox & Minton, 2015). Additionally, having a robust incident response plan that includes vendors can help mitigate the damage from supply chain cyber attacks by quickly identifying and addressing breaches before they cause widespread harm.
    
4. **Patch Management and Software Integrity**
    Ensuring that vendors provide timely security patches is essential for reducing vulnerabilities. As Exelon’s security strategist Wilcox notes, vendor patch delays can lead to critical vulnerabilities remaining unaddressed for extended periods (Wilcox & Minton, 2015). To mitigate this, companies should require vendors to stay current on patch updates and verify that all third-party software components are secure before integrating them into their systems. Proactive patch management is a fundamental part of securing software supply chains.

5. **Secure Cloud Adoption**
    With the increasing adoption of cloud services, organizations must ensure that their cloud providers adhere to strict security protocols. Vendors providing cloud services should implement continuous monitoring of data inputs and outputs to ensure data integrity. Exelon, for instance, pushes for robust monitoring capabilities during cloud contract negotiations to ensure secure data handling practices (Wilcox & Minton, 2015).

## Summary and Conclusion
Cyber and IT supply chain risks are critical issues as organizations increasingly depend on third-party vendors, cloud services, and interconnected systems. These risks arise from poorly managed vendor access, inadequate patch management, and lack of monitoring. Companies must adopt a multi-faceted approach, including comprehensive vendor management, stringent security standards, continuous monitoring, and effective incident response plans.

Exelon’s practices exemplify how to integrate vendor security into a broader cybersecurity strategy. Experts further stress the importance of defining security controls, performing regular assessments, and adopting secure cloud practices. Managing cyber and IT supply chain risks is vital for business continuity and protection against data breaches or attacks. By prioritizing these best practices, organizations can reduce their exposure to vulnerabilities and better safeguard their operations from cyber threats.
