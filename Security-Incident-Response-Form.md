## Incident Details
- **Status change date/timestamps**: Incident began on January 10, 2024 at 09:00 AM, discovered at 01:30 PM, reported by 02:00 PM, and resolved by January 12, 2024 at 05:00 PM.
- **Physical location of the incident**: Sifers-Grayson R&D Center, Grayson County, Kentucky, USA.
- **Current status of the incident**: Resolved. The penetration test by the external Red Team was completed and all vulnerabilities were addressed.
- **Source/cause of the incident**: Initiated through a controlled penetration test by an external Red Team. Main vectors included an unprotected network connection and rogue USB devices with keylogging software left in the lunch room.
- **Description of the incident**: Unauthorized access was gained to R&D servers RDServer01 and RDServer02, with exfiltration of critical design documents and source code for the AX10 Drone System. Keylogging devices compromised employee credentials.
- **Description of affected resources**: Compromised resources included internal network servers (RDServer01 and RDServer02) and workstations (RDWorkstation30 and RDWorkstation31), along with critical design documents and employee login credentials.
- **Incident category**: Penetration Test / Security Breach Simulation.
- **Prioritization factors**: High functional and information impact, medium recoverability.
- **Mitigating factors**: Limited due to lack of a formal incident response team and inadequate IT infrastructure.
- **Response actions performed**: No effective incident response during the test; intrusion went undetected. Post-incident, forensic investigation capabilities were hindered by a lack of trained personnel and insufficient logging.
- **Other organizations contacted**: No external organizations were involved as it was a controlled test environment.

## Cause of the Incident
Technical vulnerabilities and lapses in security protocol were the primary causes. The effectiveness of rogue USB devices highlighted gaps in physical security and employee cybersecurity awareness.

## Cost of the Incident
Estimated labor cost: $20,000 based on 200 hours at $100 per hour. Potential indirect costs like productivity losses, data loss, or reputational damage are not included.

## Business Impact of the Incident
Unauthorized access to sensitive data could lead to competitive disadvantage and trust erosion among clients. The incident also spotlighted compliance shortfalls with cybersecurity standards.

## General Comments
The penetration test highlighted the need for enhancements in cybersecurity framework, including a formal incident response plan, comprehensive employee training, and stronger technical safeguards. Continuous improvement in cybersecurity practices is essential.
